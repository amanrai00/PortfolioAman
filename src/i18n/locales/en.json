        "p1": "This project started from my own experience studying for and taking the JLPT N2.",
        "p2": "While studying, I realized that memorizing grammar and kanji in isolation has its limits. No matter how much you memorize, without actually solving real JLPT questions, it's hard to see how grammar is used and how it's tested. There's so much you can only truly understand by encountering grammar within question passages and answer choices.",
        "p3": "At the same time, going through full past exams every time isn't realistic either. With so many questions and the time they require, you can get exhausted before even starting to review. Especially when studying alongside work and daily life, long practice sessions can become stressful and lead to anxiety and tension.",
        "p4": "These struggles inspired me to start this project."

      "coreIdea": {
        "title": "Core Concept",
        "p1": "At the heart of this project is the idea of learning and deepening understanding through past JLPT questions.",
        "p2": "Rather than repeatedly solving full exam papers, the goal is to break past questions into small, manageable practice units where each question can be reviewed carefully. For each question, the platform clearly explains which grammar pattern is being used, why the correct answer is correct, and why the other options are wrong. The emphasis is on naturally understanding grammar patterns through problem-solving, rather than relying on memorization."

        "p2": "The layout is kept simple and easy to read, so learners can study calmly without unnecessary anxiety or stress. The aim is to create a comfortable learning experience where you can think, \"Let me just practice a little today,\" without feeling overwhelmed."
